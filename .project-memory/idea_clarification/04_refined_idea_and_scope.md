# Refined Idea and Scope - Console Calculator

This document outlines the refined project idea and scope after initial review.
*(As of 2025-05-13, no significant refinement has occurred beyond the initial request.)*

## Core Request
Create a simple console-based calculator application in Python.

## Key Features
1.  Accept user input in the format "number operator number" (e.g., "5 + 3").
2.  Support basic mathematical operations:
    *   Addition (+)
    *   Subtraction (-)
    *   Multiplication (*)
    *   Division (/)
3.  Handle basic error conditions:
    *   Division by zero
    *   Invalid input format (non-numeric, incorrect operator, incorrect number of arguments)
4.  Allow user to exit the application by typing "exit" or "quit" (case-insensitive).
5.  Display the result of the operation and wait for the next input (REPL behavior).
6.  Clear and user-friendly error messages.

## Desired Qualities
*   Well-structured Python code (e.g., functions for parsing, calculation, error handling).
*   Testable components with unit tests covering core logic and edge cases.
*   Documented:
    *   High-Level Design (HLD)
    *   Low-Level Design (LLD) for key modules
    *   Code comments
    *   Test plan and cases
    *   Simple user manual

## Out of Scope (for initial version)
*   Advanced mathematical operations (e.g., exponentiation, roots, trigonometry).
*   Support for order of operations (e.g., "5 + 3 * 2" evaluating multiplication first).
*   Handling of floating-point precision issues beyond standard Python float behavior.
*   Graphical User Interface (GUI).
*   Memory functions (M+, MR, MC).
*   History of operations.

## Deliverables
A complete, runnable Python console application with associated documentation and tests as outlined above.
