## Source
User request received on 2025-05-13.

## Core Request
Create a simple console-based calculator application in Python.

## Key Features Requested
1.  Accept user input in the format "number operator number" (e.g., "5 + 3").
2.  Support basic mathematical operations:

    *   Subtraction (-)
    *   Multiplication (*)
    *   Division (/)
3.  Handle basic error conditions:
    *   Division by zero
    *   Invalid input format
4.  Allow user to exit the application by typing "exit" or "quit".
5.  Display the result of the operation and wait for the next input (REPL behavior).

## Desired Qualities
*   Well-structured code.
*   Testable components.
*   Documented (specifications, architecture, implementation, tests, user manual).

## Deliverables
Complete solution including:
*   Specification documents.
*   Architecture documents.
*   Python implementation code.
*   Unit tests.
