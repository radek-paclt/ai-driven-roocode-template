# Project Postulates

These are the foundational principles that all AI agents must adhere to throughout the development process. These postulates are immutable and serve as the guiding framework for all development activities.

## Core Development Principles

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD) is mandatory**
   - Tests MUST be written before implementation code
   - All code MUST have corresponding tests
   - No functionality should be considered complete without passing tests

2. **Modularity and Separation of Concerns**
   - Each component should have a single, well-defined responsibility
   - Dependencies between components should be explicit and minimized
   - Interfaces between components should be clearly defined

3. **Documentation is a first-class citizen**
   - All code MUST be documented with clear, concise comments
   - All APIs MUST have comprehensive documentation
   - Architecture decisions MUST be documented with rationales

4. **Security by Design**
   - Security considerations MUST be addressed from the beginning
   - All input MUST be validated and sanitized
   - Sensitive data MUST be properly protected

## Communication and Workflow Principles

1. **Clear Role Boundaries**
   - Each agent has specific responsibilities and should not overstep them
   - Agents MUST NOT directly call other agents; all delegation happens through the Orchestrator
   - When an agent completes its task, it MUST return to the Orchestrator

2. **Structured Communication**
   - All task delegations MUST follow the `new_task` message structure
   - All task completions MUST follow the `attempt_completion` message structure
   - Communication MUST be clear, concise, and focused on the task at hand

3. **Persistent Memory Management**
   - All important information MUST be stored in the `.project-memory/` directory
   - The Orchestrator is responsible for managing and versioning the `.project-memory/` directory
   - Agents MUST follow the established structure and naming conventions for `.project-memory/` files

4. **Continuous Progress Tracking**
   - The Orchestrator MUST maintain a clear record of project progress
   - All completed and pending tasks MUST be tracked
   - Blockers and issues MUST be explicitly documented

## Quality and Standards

1. **Code Quality**
   - Code MUST follow established style guides and best practices
   - Code MUST be readable, maintainable, and performant
   - Technical debt MUST be explicitly documented if incurred

2. **Semantic Versioning and Commits**
   - All commits MUST follow semantic commit conventions
   - Version numbers MUST follow semantic versioning principles
   - Changes MUST be traceable through commit history

3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Feedback MUST be incorporated into the development process
   - Processes SHOULD be regularly reviewed and improved
   - Knowledge gained SHOULD be documented for future reference

## Business Value Principles

1. **Business Value Focus**
   - All development activities MUST contribute to business value
   - Technical decisions MUST be justified in terms of business impact
   - User needs MUST be prioritized over technical preferences

2. **Transparency with Business Owner**
   - Technical concepts MUST be explained clearly to the Business Owner
   - The Business Owner MUST be regularly updated on progress
   - Decisions requiring Business Owner input MUST be clearly flagged
