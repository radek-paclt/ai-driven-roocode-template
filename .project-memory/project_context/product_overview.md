# Product Overview - Console Calculator

## 1. Purpose and Vision

The Console Calculator is a simple command-line application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. Its purpose is to provide a straightforward, easy-to-use tool for quick calculations without needing a graphical interface. The vision is to create a well-structured, testable, and documented Python application that serves as a foundational example of the SPARC development process.

## 2. Key Features

*   **Input Parsing**: Accepts user input in the format "number operator number" (e.g., "5 + 3").
*   **Basic Operations**: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
*   **Error Handling**: Manages common errors such as division by zero and invalid input formats.
*   **Interactive Loop (REPL)**: Continuously prompts the user for input until explicitly exited.
*   **Exit Command**: Allows users to terminate the application using "exit" or "quit".

## 3. Target Users

*   Users who prefer or require a command-line interface.
*   Developers looking for a simple example of a Python CLI application.
*   Students learning basic programming concepts.

## 4. Architecture Overview (Anticipated)

The application is expected to have a modular design:
*   **Main Application Loop**: Handles user interaction, input reading, and output display.
*   **Input Parser**: Validates and parses the user's input string into numbers and an operator.
*   **Calculation Engine**: Performs the specified arithmetic operation.
*   **Error Handling Module**: Manages and formats error messages.

## 5. Technology Stack

*   **Language**: Python 3.x

## 6. Success Criteria

*   The application correctly performs all specified arithmetic operations.
*   Error conditions are handled gracefully with informative messages.
*   The application can be exited cleanly.
*   The codebase is well-structured, commented, and includes unit tests.
*   All requested documentation (HLD, LLD, test plan, user manual) is delivered.
