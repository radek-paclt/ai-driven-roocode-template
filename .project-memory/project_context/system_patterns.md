# System Patterns

This document describes recurring architectural or design patterns anticipated or used in the Console Calculator project.

| Pattern Name          | Description                                                                                                | Rationale                                                                    | Examples in Project (Anticipated)        |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **REPL** (Read-Eval-Print Loop) | An interactive programming environment that takes single user inputs, executes them, and returns the result. | Standard for console applications requiring continuous user interaction.   | Main application loop.                   |
| **Input Validation**  | The process of ensuring that user-provided data meets certain criteria before processing.                  | To prevent errors, crashes, and ensure data integrity.                       | Validating "number operator number" format, checking for division by zero. |
| **Modular Design**    | Breaking down the system into smaller, independent, and interchangeable modules or components.             | Improves maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns.         | Parser module, calculation module, UI module. |
| **Error Handling**    | Strategies for detecting, reporting, and recovering from error conditions.                                 | To provide a robust and user-friendly experience.                            | Specific error messages for invalid input or operations. |
|                       |                                                                                                            |                                                                              |                                          |
