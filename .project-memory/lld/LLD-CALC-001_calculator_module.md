# Calculation Engine - Low-Level Design

## 1. Component Overview

### 1.1. Purpose and Scope
The Calculation Engine is a core component of the Python Console Calculator application. Its sole responsibility is to perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) based on validated numerical inputs and an operator. It also handles calculation-specific errors, primarily division by zero.

### 1.2. Relationship to Other Components
-   **Receives input from**: `REPLHandler` (which gets validated and parsed input originally from `InputParser`).
-   **Sends output to**: `REPLHandler`.
-   The `CalculationEngine` relies on the `InputParser` (via `REPLHandler`) to provide valid numerical operands (floats) and a supported operator string.

## 2. Detailed Design

The Calculation Engine will be implemented as a single function or a class with a primary method. For simplicity and given the stateless nature of the calculation, a single function is preferred.

### 2.1. Main Calculation Function

#### Signature (Python type hints):
```python
from typing import Dict, Union, Literal

Operator = Literal["+", "-", "*", "/"]
CalculationResult = Dict[str, Union[bool, str, float, None]]

def perform_calculation(
    operand1: float,
    operator: Operator,
    operand2: float
) -> CalculationResult:
    # Implementation details below
    pass
```

#### Parameters:
-   `operand1` (float): The first number in the expression.
-   `operator` (Operator): The arithmetic operator (one of "+", "-", "*", "/").
-   `operand2` (float): The second number in theexpression.

#### Returns (`CalculationResult`):
A dictionary with the following structure:
-   If successful:
    ```json
    {
        "has_error": False,
        "value": <calculated_float_result>,
        "error_message": None
    }
    ```
-   If an error occurs (e.g., division by zero):
    ```json
    {
        "has_error": True,
        "value": None,
        "error_message": "<specific_error_message_string>"
    }
    ```

## 3. Interface Specifications
The interface is defined by the `perform_calculation` function signature detailed in section 2.1.

## 4. Data Design
-   **Input Data**: `operand1` (float), `operator` (string: "+", "-", "*", "/"), `operand2` (float).
-   **Output Data**: A dictionary (`CalculationResult`) as described above.
-   **Internal Data Structures**: No complex internal data structures are required. The function operates directly on its input parameters.

## 5. Behavior Specifications

### 5.1. Core Calculation Logic (Pseudocode)

```pseudocode
FUNCTION perform_calculation(operand1: float, operator: string, operand2: float):
    IF operator == "+":
        result_value = operand1 + operand2
        RETURN { has_error: FALSE, value: result_value, error_message: NULL }
    ELSE IF operator == "-":
        result_value = operand1 - operand2
        RETURN { has_error: FALSE, value: result_value, error_message: NULL }
    ELSE IF operator == "*":
        result_value = operand1 * operand2
        RETURN { has_error: FALSE, value: result_value, error_message: NULL }
    ELSE IF operator == "/":
        IF operand2 == 0.0:
            RETURN { has_error: TRUE, value: NULL, error_message: "Error: Division by zero is not allowed." }
        ELSE:
            result_value = operand1 / operand2
            RETURN { has_error: FALSE, value: result_value, error_message: NULL }
        END IF
    // This case should not be reached if inputs are validated by the InputParser as per HLD.
    // However, as a defensive measure, an internal error could be signaled.
    ELSE: 
        RETURN { has_error: TRUE, value: NULL, error_message: "Error: Internal - Unknown operator received by CalculationEngine." }
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

## 6. Error Handling and Logging

### 6.1. Error Handling
-   **Division by Zero**:
    -   **Detection**: The `perform_calculation` function explicitly checks if `operand2` is `0.0` when the `operator` is `/`.
    -   **Signaling**: If detected, it returns a `CalculationResult` dictionary with `has_error: True` and `error_message: "Error: Division by zero is not allowed."`. This message is consistent with [SPEC-MAIN-001_console_calculator_main_specification.md](../../specifications/SPEC-MAIN-001_console_calculator_main_specification.md#section-8).
-   **Unknown Operator**:
    -   Although the `InputParser` is responsible for validating operators, the `CalculationEngine` includes a fallback case in its logic to handle an unexpected operator. This would indicate an internal logic error or a breakdown in the component interaction assumptions.
    -   **Signaling**: Returns `CalculationResult` with `has_error: True` and `error_message: "Error: Internal - Unknown operator received by CalculationEngine."`.

### 6.2. Logging
-   Logging is not explicitly required for this component in V1. Errors are signaled back to the caller (`REPLHandler`) for display to the user.

## 7. Security Considerations
-   The `CalculationEngine` assumes that its inputs (`operand1`, `operator`, `operand2`) have been validated and sanitized by the `InputParser` component, as per the HLD.
-   Specifically, `operand1` and `operand2` are expected to be valid floats, and `operator` a valid, known operator string.
-   Therefore, the risk of direct security vulnerabilities within this component (e.g., code injection via operator string) is minimal, provided the upstream validation is robust.
-   The component does not perform any I/O operations, network calls, or file system access.

## 8. Testing Considerations
-   The `perform_calculation` function is a pure function (output depends only on input, no side effects), making it highly testable at the unit level.
-   **Unit tests** should cover:
    -   Correct calculation for each supported operator (+, -, *, /) with various valid float inputs (positive, negative, zero where appropriate).
    -   Division of a number by zero (`operand2 = 0.0`).
    -   Division of zero by a non-zero number (`operand1 = 0.0, operand2 != 0.0`).
    -   (Optional, for robustness) Behavior if an unexpected operator string is passed, though this scenario implies a failure in upstream validation.
