# Overall Test Plan - Python Console Calculator

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the overall testing strategy and plan for the Python Console Calculator application. It is based on the [Console Calculator - Main Specification](../../specifications/SPEC-MAIN-001_console_calculator_main_specification.md) and the [Console Calculator - High-Level Design](../../hld/HLD-MAIN-001_main_architecture.md). The primary goal of this test plan is to ensure the application meets the specified requirements and quality standards, with a strong emphasis on Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles as mandated by the [Project Postulates](../../project_postulates.md).

## 2. Test Strategy

### 2.1. Approach

The testing approach will be heavily rooted in **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. This means:
1.  Tests will be written *before* the implementation code for any given piece of functionality.
2.  Tests will initially fail (Red).
3.  Implementation code will be written to make the tests pass (Green).
4.  Code will be refactored while ensuring tests continue to pass (Refactor).

This iterative cycle will be applied at different levels of testing (Unit, Integration).

### 2.2. TDD Focus

*   **Unit Tests**: Each function or method within the `InputParser` and `CalculationEngine` components will have corresponding unit tests written first to define its expected behavior, including handling of valid inputs, invalid inputs, and edge cases.
*   **Integration Tests**: Tests for the interaction between components (e.g., `REPLHandler` with `InputParser`, `REPLHandler` with `CalculationEngine`) will be designed to verify data flow and error propagation.
*   **System/E2E Tests**: While full E2E automation for a console app can be complex, tests simulating user interaction flows (input expression -> get result/error) will be considered to validate the REPL behavior.

## 3. Scope of Testing

### 3.1. Features to be Tested

Based on the [Main Specification](../../specifications/SPEC-MAIN-001_console_calculator_main_specification.md), the following features and functionalities will be tested:

*   **FR1. Input Acceptance**: Console input handling.
*   **FR2. Input Format**: Adherence to "number operator number" format.
    *   Integer and floating-point number handling.
*   **FR3. Supported Operations**:
    *   Addition (+)
    *   Subtraction (-)
    *   Multiplication (*)
    *   Division (/)
*   **FR4. Calculation**: Correctness of arithmetic results.
*   **FR5. Output Display**: Correct display of results and errors.
*   **FR6. REPL Behavior**: Continuous loop for input until exit.
*   **FR7. Exit Condition**: "exit" or "quit" commands (case-insensitive).
*   **FR8. Error Handling - Division by Zero**: Detection and user-friendly message.
*   **FR9. Error Handling - Invalid Input Format**:
    *   Non-numeric values.
    *   Unrecognized operators.
    *   Incorrect number of arguments.
*   **FR10. Clear Error Messages**: Verification of message clarity.
*   **Edge Cases** (as per Sec 9 of Specification):
    *   Input with extra spaces.
    *   Floating point numbers.
    *   Negative numbers as input.
    *   Zero as an operand.
    *   Case sensitivity of exit commands.

### 3.2. Features Not to be Tested (Out of Scope for V1)

As per the [Refined Idea and Scope](../../idea_clarification/04_refined_idea_and_scope.md):
*   Advanced mathematical operations.
*   Order of operations (PEMDAS).
*   Specific floating-point precision issues beyond standard Python behavior.
*   Graphical User Interface (GUI).
*   Memory functions (M+, MR, MC).
*   History of operations.
*   Performance under load (not a primary concern for this application).
*   Security vulnerabilities beyond basic input sanitization (e.g., `eval` is not used).

## 4. Types of Testing

### 4.1. Unit Testing

*   **Objective**: To verify individual components (functions/methods) of the application in isolation.
*   **Scope**:
    *   `InputParser` component:
        *   Parsing valid expressions for all operators.
        *   Handling invalid formats (incorrect parts, non-numeric operands, invalid operators).
        *   Handling inputs with varying spaces.
    *   `CalculationEngine` component:
        *   Correct calculation for all supported operations with integers and floats (positive, negative, zero).
        *   Correct handling of division by zero.
*   **Tools**: Python's built-in `unittest` module or `pytest`.
*   **Responsibility**: TDD Tester to define, Auto-Coder to implement to pass.

### 4.2. Integration Testing

*   **Objective**: To verify the interaction and data flow between components.
*   **Scope**:
    *   Interaction between `REPLHandler` and `InputParser`:
        *   Passing raw input and receiving parsed data or error structures.
    *   Interaction between `REPLHandler` and `CalculationEngine`:
        *   Passing parsed data and receiving calculation results or error structures.
    *   Correct propagation of error messages from `InputParser` and `CalculationEngine` through `REPLHandler` to the output.
*   **Tools**: `unittest` or `pytest`, potentially using mocking for isolating specific interactions.
*   **Responsibility**: TDD Tester to define, Auto-Coder to implement to pass.

### 4.3. System Testing (End-to-End for Console)

*   **Objective**: To verify the complete application flow from user input to output, simulating user interaction with the console.
*   **Scope**:
    *   Full REPL cycle: input -> parse -> calculate -> display -> loop.
    *   Correct handling of "exit" / "quit" commands.
    *   Verification of user-facing error messages for all specified error conditions as they appear on the console.
    *   Testing various valid and invalid input sequences.
*   **Approach**: May involve scripting console interactions or using libraries that can simulate `stdin` and capture `stdout`.
*   **Responsibility**: TDD Tester to define scenarios.

### 4.4. Error Handling Testing

*   **Objective**: To ensure all specified error conditions are handled gracefully and user-friendly messages are displayed.
*   **Scope**: This is integrated into Unit, Integration, and System testing. Specific test cases will target each error condition listed in Section 8 of the [Main Specification](../../specifications/SPEC-MAIN-001_console_calculator_main_specification.md).
    *   Division by Zero.
    *   Invalid Input Format (General, Operand1, Operand2).
    *   Invalid Operator.
    *   Empty Input.
*   **Responsibility**: TDD Tester to define, Auto-Coder to implement to pass.

## 5. Test Environment

*   **Programming Language**: Python 3.x (specific version to be aligned with development, e.g., Python 3.9+).
*   **Operating System**: Testing should primarily occur on the development OS (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS). OS-specific console behavior differences are not anticipated to be a major issue for this simple application but will be noted if observed.
*   **Dependencies**: Python standard library only. No external libraries that might affect testing environments.
*   **Test Execution**: Tests will be executable via a command-line interface (e.g., `python -m unittest discover` or `pytest`).

## 6. Test Data Requirements

*   **Unit Tests**:
    *   `InputParser`: Strings representing valid and invalid expressions (e.g., "5 + 3", "abc - 1", "10 / 0", "1 *", "1 ^ 2").
    *   `CalculationEngine`: Numerical inputs (integers, floats, positive, negative, zero) for `operand1`, `operand2`, and valid operator strings.
*   **Integration/System Tests**:
    *   Sequences of user inputs simulating a session, including valid calculations, inputs causing errors, and exit commands.
    *   Examples:
        *   `10 + 5` -> `15.0`
        *   `20 / 0` -> `Error: Division by zero is not allowed.`
        *   `hello world` -> `Error: Invalid input format. Expected 'number operator number'.`
        *   `exit` -> (application terminates)

Test data will be embedded within the test scripts or managed in simple data structures within the tests.
