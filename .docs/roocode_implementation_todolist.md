# RooCode Implementation Todolist

## Overview
This todolist outlines the steps to create a set of RooCode configuration files that implement the SPARC methodology and agent orchestration as described in the idea.md document. The implementation will use RooCode's Custom Modes and Boomerang Tasks (Orchestrator Mode) features.

**Important Note:** We are only creating the RooCode configuration files. The `.project-memory` directory will be generated by the Orchestrator during actual use. The custom instructions for each mode will include guidelines on how to work with the memory bank structure described in idea.md.

## Tasks

### 1. Create Basic Project Structure
- [x] Create `.roo` directory in the project root
- [x] Create subdirectories for rules and mode-specific rules

### 2. Define Core SPARC Agents as Custom Modes
- [x] Create `custom_modes.json` with definitions for all SPARC agents:
  - [x] SPARC Orchestrator (`sparc`)
  - [x] Specification Writer (`spec-pseudocode`)
  - [x] Architect (`architect`)
  - [x] Auto-Coder (`code`)
  - [x] Tester (TDD) (`tdd`)
  - [x] Documentation Writer (`docs-writer`)
  - [x] Security Reviewer (`security-review`)
  - [x] (Optional) Mediator Agent

### 3. Create Custom Instructions for Each Mode
- [x] Create `.roo/rules/` directory with global rules
  - [x] Project postulates
  - [x] General coding standards
  - [x] Documentation standards
  - [x] Communication protocols
  - [x] Guidelines for `.project-memory` structure and usage
- [x] Create mode-specific rules directories:
  - [x] `.roo/rules-sparc/` (Orchestrator rules)
    - [x] Instructions for creating and managing `.project-memory` structure
    - [x] Guidelines for Git versioning of `.project-memory`
    - [x] Task delegation and management protocols
  - [x] `.roo/rules-spec-pseudocode/` (Specification Writer rules)
    - [x] Guidelines for creating specifications in `.project-memory/lld/`
  - [x] `.roo/rules-architect/` (Architect rules)
    - [x] Guidelines for creating architecture documents in `.project-memory/hld/`
    - [x] Instructions for BV communication and clarification
  - [x] `.roo/rules-code/` (Auto-Coder rules)
    - [x] Guidelines for implementing code based on specifications
  - [x] `.roo/rules-tdd/` (Tester rules)
    - [x] Guidelines for creating tests based on specifications
  - [x] `.roo/rules-docs-writer/` (Documentation Writer rules)
    - [x] Guidelines for creating documentation based on `.project-memory`
  - [x] `.roo/rules-security-review/` (Security Reviewer rules)
    - [x] Guidelines for security audits
  - [x] `.roo/rules-mediator/` (Mediator Agent rules)
    - [x] Guidelines for conflict resolution

### 4. Implement Communication Protocols
- [x] Define `new_task` message structure in Orchestrator rules
- [x] Define `attempt_completion` message structure in Orchestrator rules
- [x] Create templates for task delegation and completion reporting

### 5. Create Documentation
- [x] Create README.md explaining the implementation
- [x] Document how to use the SPARC methodology with RooCode
- [x] Create examples of typical workflows

## Implementation Notes
- All configuration files will be in English
- The implementation will follow RooCode's documentation for Custom Modes and Boomerang Tasks
- The structure will align with the SPARC methodology as described in idea.md
- Custom instructions will include detailed guidelines on how each mode should interact with the `.project-memory` structure
