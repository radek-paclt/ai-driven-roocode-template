# Coding Standards

This document outlines the general coding standards that should be followed across all programming languages and frameworks used in the project. Language-specific standards may be defined in separate documents.

## General Principles

1. **Readability Over Cleverness**
   - Code should be written for humans to read and understand
   - Avoid overly clever or obscure techniques that sacrifice readability
   - Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes

2. **Consistency**
   - Follow consistent patterns throughout the codebase
   - Use consistent naming conventions, formatting, and organization
   - When modifying existing code, follow the established patterns

3. **Simplicity**
   - Keep functions, classes, and modules small and focused
   - Follow the Single Responsibility Principle
   - Avoid unnecessary complexity and over-engineering

4. **Documentation**
   - Document all public APIs, classes, and functions
   - Include purpose, parameters, return values, and exceptions
   - Document complex algorithms and non-obvious code

## Naming Conventions

1. **General Guidelines**
   - Names should be descriptive and reveal intent
   - Avoid abbreviations except for widely accepted ones
   - Use consistent casing conventions based on language standards

2. **Common Patterns**
   - Functions/methods should be named with verbs (e.g., `calculateTotal`, `fetchUser`)
   - Boolean variables/properties should use "is", "has", or "should" prefixes (e.g., `isValid`, `hasPermission`)
   - Collections should use plural names (e.g., `users`, `orderItems`)
   - Interfaces/abstract classes should use descriptive nouns or adjectives (e.g., `Serializable`, `Repository`)

## Code Organization

1. **File Structure**
   - One primary class/component per file
   - Group related files in directories
   - Organize directories by feature or layer, depending on project architecture

2. **Code Layout**
   - Use consistent indentation (spaces or tabs as per language convention)
   - Limit line length (typically 80-120 characters)
   - Use blank lines to separate logical sections
   - Group related code together

3. **Import/Include Organization**
   - Group imports by source/type
   - Remove unused imports
   - Avoid wildcard imports unless language convention suggests otherwise

## Comments

1. **When to Comment**
   - Comment complex algorithms and business logic
   - Explain "why" rather than "what" (the code should show what it does)
   - Document non-obvious behavior or edge cases
   - Explain temporary workarounds or technical debt (with TODO/FIXME markers)

2. **Comment Style**
   - Use consistent comment style as per language convention
   - Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
   - Write in clear, complete sentences

3. **Documentation Comments**
   - Use language-specific documentation formats (e.g., JSDoc, Javadoc)
   - Document parameters, return values, exceptions, and side effects
   - Include examples for complex APIs

## Error Handling

1. **General Principles**
   - Be explicit about error cases
   - Handle errors at the appropriate level
   - Don't swallow exceptions without good reason

2. **Logging**
   - Log errors with appropriate context
   - Use appropriate log levels (debug, info, warning, error)
   - Include relevant information for debugging

3. **User-Facing Errors**
   - Provide clear, actionable error messages to users
   - Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
   - Consider internationalization for error messages

## Testing

1. **Test Coverage**
   - Write tests for all new code
   - Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical paths
   - Test edge cases and error conditions

2. **Test Organization**
   - Organize tests to mirror the structure of the code being tested
   - Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario and expected outcome
   - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

3. **Test Quality**
   - Tests should be independent and repeatable
   - Avoid test interdependencies
   - Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Version Control

1. **Commits**
   - Use semantic commit messages
   - Keep commits focused and atomic
   - Reference issue/task IDs in commit messages

2. **Branching**
   - Follow the project's branching strategy
   - Keep branches short-lived and focused
   - Regularly merge/rebase with the main branch

## Security

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all input from external sources
   - Use parameterized queries for database access
   - Sanitize data before displaying it to users

2. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Always check authentication and authorization
   - Use secure, established authentication methods
   - Apply the principle of least privilege

3. **Sensitive Data**
   - Don't hardcode sensitive information
   - Use appropriate encryption for sensitive data
   - Be careful with logging sensitive information

## Performance

1. **General Guidelines**
   - Write efficient code, but prioritize correctness and readability
   - Optimize only after profiling identifies bottlenecks
   - Document performance considerations for critical sections

2. **Resource Management**
   - Properly manage resources (memory, connections, file handles)
   - Close resources in finally blocks or use language-specific resource management
   - Be mindful of memory usage in loops and collections
