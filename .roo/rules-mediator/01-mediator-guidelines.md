```

## Conflict Types and Resolution Strategies

### 1. Technical Conflicts

**Description:**
Disagreements about technical approaches, architecture, or implementation details.

**Common Causes:**
- Different technical backgrounds or experiences
- Varying priorities (performance vs. maintainability, etc.)
- Different understanding of requirements
- Competing technical constraints

**Resolution Strategies:**
- Focus on objective criteria and data
- Conduct proof-of-concept implementations
- Use established design principles and patterns
- Consider hybrid approaches that incorporate elements from both sides
- Refer to industry best practices

**Example:**
```markdown
## Technical Conflict Resolution: Authentication Approach

### Conflict
The Architect proposes JWT-based authentication while the Security Reviewer advocates for session-based authentication.

### Resolution
Implement a hybrid approach:
- Use short-lived JWTs for API authentication (addressing performance concerns)
- Store refresh tokens server-side with proper invalidation (addressing security concerns)
- Implement additional security measures like token rotation and fingerprinting
- Add monitoring for suspicious token usage

This approach balances the statelessness and performance benefits of JWTs while addressing the security concerns about revocation and monitoring.
```

### 2. Priority Conflicts

**Description:**
Disagreements about what to prioritize or which tasks should be completed first.

**Common Causes:**
- Different understanding of project goals
- Varying perspectives on what constitutes value
- Resource constraints requiring trade-offs
- Interdependencies between tasks

**Resolution Strategies:**
- Align on project goals and success criteria
- Use objective prioritization frameworks (MoSCoW, RICE, etc.)
- Consider sequencing that addresses multiple priorities
- Identify critical path items
- Balance short-term and long-term considerations

**Example:**
```markdown
## Priority Conflict Resolution: Feature vs. Technical Debt

### Conflict
The Auto-Coder prioritizes implementing new features while the TDD Tester advocates for addressing technical debt and improving test coverage first.

### Resolution
Implement a balanced approach:
- Allocate 70% of effort to new features and 30% to technical debt/testing
- Prioritize technical debt items that directly impact new feature development
- Establish minimum test coverage requirements for new features
- Create a technical debt backlog with clear prioritization
- Schedule regular "quality sprints" focused on technical debt

This approach ensures progress on new features while systematically addressing technical debt to prevent future issues.
```

### 3. Interpretation Conflicts

**Description:**
Disagreements about the interpretation of requirements or specifications.

**Common Causes:**
- Ambiguous or incomplete specifications
- Different understanding of business context
- Varying assumptions about user needs
- Implicit vs. explicit requirements

**Resolution Strategies:**
- Return to source documentation
- Seek clarification from the Business Owner (through the Orchestrator)
- Document assumptions explicitly
- Create concrete examples or scenarios
- Use visual representations to align understanding

**Example:**
```markdown
## Interpretation Conflict Resolution: User Permission Model

### Conflict
The Specification Writer interprets "user roles" as a simple role-based system, while the Architect interprets it as a more complex permission-based system.

### Resolution
Clarify and refine the specification:
- Implement a role-based system with predefined permission sets as the initial version
- Design the database schema to support future extension to a more granular permission model
- Document the current interpretation and future extension path
- Create specific user stories that illustrate the expected behavior
- Seek Business Owner confirmation of the approach

This approach satisfies immediate needs while allowing for future flexibility as requirements evolve.
```

### 4. Resource Conflicts

**Description:**
Disagreements about how to allocate limited resources (time, complexity budget, etc.).

**Common Causes:**
- Limited time or budget
- Performance constraints
- Complexity limitations
- Competing resource needs

**Resolution Strategies:**
- Prioritize based on business value
- Consider phased approaches
- Evaluate ROI of different allocations
- Look for resource-efficient alternatives
- Balance short-term and long-term resource usage

**Example:**
```markdown
## Resource Conflict Resolution: Performance vs. Development Time

### Conflict
The Auto-Coder proposes a complex, highly optimized solution that would take significant development time, while the Architect advocates for a simpler solution that can be implemented quickly.

### Resolution
Implement a staged approach:
- Start with the simpler solution to meet immediate needs
- Establish clear performance metrics and thresholds
- Design the simple solution with hooks for future optimization
- Create a performance testing framework to identify actual bottlenecks
- Plan for targeted optimizations based on real-world usage data

This approach delivers value quickly while establishing a foundation for performance improvements where they will have the most impact.
```

## Communication Techniques

### 1. Neutral Framing

Present information objectively:
- Use neutral language
- Avoid assigning blame
- Focus on facts rather than interpretations
- Present multiple perspectives fairly

Example:
```
Instead of: "The Architect's approach is overly complex and will cause maintenance issues."
Use: "The architectural approach has higher initial complexity, which raises questions about long-term maintenance. The alternative approach prioritizes simplicity but may have limitations in scalability."
```

### 2. Interest-Based Questioning

Ask questions that uncover underlying interests:
- "What problem are you trying to solve with this approach?"
- "What concerns do you have about the alternative approach?"
- "What would an ideal solution look like from your perspective?"
- "What constraints are you working within?"

### 3. Reframing

Reframe the conflict to focus on shared goals:
- "It seems we all want a solution that is both secure and performant."
- "Both approaches aim to meet the user needs, but differ in implementation strategy."
- "The core question appears to be how to balance immediate delivery with long-term maintainability."

### 4. Summarizing

Regularly summarize points of agreement and disagreement:
- "So far, we agree on X, Y, and Z, but still have different views on A and B."
- "The main points of contention seem to be X and Y, while we have alignment on Z."
- "Let me summarize the proposed compromise to ensure we're all on the same page."

### Example: Technical Approach Conflict

```markdown
# Conflict Resolution: MED-CONF-001

## Date
2023-05-15

## Participants
- Architect
- Security Reviewer
- Mediator Agent

## Conflict Summary
The Architect proposed a microservices architecture for the system, while the Security Reviewer advocated for a monolithic approach with clear security boundaries, citing concerns about the security complexity of microservices.

## Resolution Process

### Conflict Assessment
The conflict centered on the architectural approach for the system, with significant implications for development complexity, security, and scalability. The root cause appeared to be different prioritization of concerns (scalability vs. security manageability).

### Perspective Analysis
**Architect Perspective:**
- Prioritized scalability and team autonomy
- Concerned about future growth constraints
- Valued independent deployability
- Had experience with successful microservices implementations

**Security Reviewer Perspective:**
- Prioritized security boundary clarity
- Concerned about service-to-service authentication complexity
- Valued centralized security control
- Had experience with security issues in distributed systems

### Common Ground
- Both wanted a secure, maintainable system
- Both acknowledged the need for clear component boundaries
- Both recognized the importance of scalability for future growth
- Both valued deployment flexibility

### Solution Development
Three options were considered:
1. Full microservices architecture
2. Monolithic architecture
3. Modular monolith with service extraction capability

### Recommended Resolution
Implement a modular monolith with a path to service extraction:
- Start with a modular monolith with clear internal boundaries
- Design interfaces between modules as if they were services
- Implement a robust authentication/authorization framework that can work both internally and externally
- Create a roadmap for extracting high-value modules into services as needed
- Establish clear security patterns for both internal and external communication

## Implementation Plan
1. Architect to revise the architecture document with the modular approach
2. Security Reviewer to develop security patterns for both internal and future external communications
3. Both to collaborate on a service extraction roadmap
4. Update the HLD to reflect the new approach

## Lessons Learned
- Early collaboration between architecture and security is essential
- Hybrid approaches often address multiple concerns better than pure approaches
- Explicit evolution paths help resolve "now vs. future" tensions
```

### Example: Priority Conflict

```markdown
# Conflict Resolution: MED-CONF-002

## Date
2023-05-20

## Participants
- Specification Writer
- TDD Tester
- Mediator Agent

## Conflict Summary
The Specification Writer wanted to proceed with defining all features in detail before any implementation, while the TDD Tester advocated for an incremental approach with specification, testing, and implementation proceeding feature by feature.

## Resolution Process

### Conflict Assessment
This conflict centered on process and sequencing, with implications for project timeline and quality. The root cause was different mental models of the development process and risk management.

### Perspective Analysis
**Specification Writer Perspective:**
- Valued comprehensive, consistent specifications
- Concerned about rework if specifications changed
- Preferred holistic view of the system
- Wanted to ensure all dependencies were identified upfront

**TDD Tester Perspective:**
- Valued early feedback on specifications through tests
- Concerned about specification issues being discovered late
- Preferred incremental validation
- Wanted to ensure testability of features

### Common Ground
- Both wanted high-quality, implementable specifications
- Both valued efficiency and minimizing rework
- Both recognized the importance of identifying dependencies
- Both wanted to ensure the final system met requirements

### Solution Development
Three options were considered:
1. Complete all specifications, then proceed to testing and implementation
2. Fully incremental approach (specify, test, implement) one feature at a time
3. Hybrid approach with initial architectural specifications followed by incremental feature development

### Recommended Resolution
Implement a hybrid approach:
- Create architectural and core data model specifications upfront
- Develop a feature dependency graph to identify critical path
- Group features into logical batches for incremental development
- For each batch: specify, test, and implement before moving to the next batch
- Maintain a living specification document that evolves as learning occurs

## Implementation Plan
1. Specification Writer to complete architectural and data model specifications
2. Both to collaborate on feature dependency graph and batch planning
3. Implement the first batch using the incremental approach
4. Review and adjust the process before proceeding to the next batch

## Lessons Learned
- Process conflicts often reflect different risk management strategies
- Hybrid approaches can combine the strengths of different methodologies
- Explicit planning of dependencies helps resolve sequencing conflicts
- Small-scale trials of processes can build confidence in new approaches
