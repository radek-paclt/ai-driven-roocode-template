# System Monitoring Configuration

## Overview
This guide explains how to configure the monitoring system to track application performance, resource usage, and detect potential issues.

## Prerequisites
- Administrative access to the system
- Monitoring agent installed (version 2.x or higher)
- Network access to the monitoring server

## Configuration File
The monitoring configuration is defined in `config/monitoring.yaml`:

```yaml
monitoring:
  server: "https://monitor.example.com"
  interval: 60  # seconds
  log_level: "info"
  metrics:
    - name: "cpu_usage"
      enabled: true
      threshold: 80  # percentage
      alert: true
    - name: "memory_usage"
      enabled: true
      threshold: 90  # percentage
      alert: true
```

## Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| server | string | - | URL of the monitoring server (required) |
| interval | integer | 60 | Metrics collection interval in seconds |
| log_level | string | "info" | Logging level (debug, info, warn, error) |
| metrics.name | string | - | Name of the metric to collect |
| metrics.enabled | boolean | true | Whether to collect this metric |
| metrics.threshold | number | - | Threshold for alerting |
| metrics.alert | boolean | false | Whether to send alerts for this metric |

## Setting Up Alerts
To configure alert notifications:

1. Create an alert configuration file at `config/alerts.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   alerts:
     email:
       enabled: true
       recipients: ["admin@example.com"]
     slack:
       enabled: false
       webhook: ""
   ```

2. Restart the monitoring service:
   ```bash
   systemctl restart monitoring-agent
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Agent Not Connecting
If the agent cannot connect to the monitoring server:
1. Verify network connectivity: `ping monitor.example.com`
2. Check server URL in configuration
3. Verify firewall rules allow outbound connections on port 443
4. Check agent logs: `journalctl -u monitoring-agent`

#### High CPU Alerts
If receiving frequent CPU usage alerts:
1. Check system load: `top` or `htop`
2. Identify resource-intensive processes
3. Consider adjusting the threshold in configuration
4. Review application performance optimization options
```

#### For Developers

- **Language**: Technical, precise terminology
- **Structure**: Reference-oriented organization
- **Content Focus**: APIs, integration points, technical details
- **Examples**: Code samples, API requests/responses
- **Visuals**: Architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, data models
- **Tone**: Technical, concise, precise
