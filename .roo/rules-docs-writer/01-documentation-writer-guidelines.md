  - Group related information together
  - Progress from general to specific

- **Use Lists and Tables**
  - Use bulleted lists for unordered items
  - Use numbered lists for sequential steps
  - Use tables for structured data
  - Keep lists and tables consistent in format

- **Include Navigation Aids**
  - Add a table of contents for longer documents
  - Use cross-references to related information
  - Include "Next Steps" or "See Also" sections
  - Provide breadcrumbs or navigation paths

### 3. Code Examples and Commands

- **Provide Clear Examples**
  - Include practical, realistic examples
  - Show complete, working code where possible
  - Explain what the example demonstrates
  - Include expected output where appropriate

- **Format Code Properly**

## Working with Source Material

### 1. Using `.project-memory/` Artifacts

- **High-Level Design (HLD)**
  - Use for architectural overview
  - Simplify technical details for end users
  - Focus on concepts relevant to users
  - Create visual representations of architecture

- **Low-Level Design (LLD)**
  - Use for detailed feature documentation
  - Transform technical specifications into user instructions
  - Extract API details and parameters
  - Identify edge cases and limitations

- **Specifications**
  - Use for feature descriptions and capabilities
  - Extract user-facing requirements
  - Identify configuration options
  - Note dependencies and prerequisites

### 2. Code Analysis

- **API Endpoints**
  - Document all public endpoints
  - Include parameters, responses, and status codes
  - Note authentication requirements
  - Provide request and response examples

- **Configuration Options**
  - Document all configurable options
  - Include default values and allowed values
  - Explain the purpose and effect of each option
  - Provide configuration examples

- **Error Handling**
  - Document error codes and messages
  - Explain common error scenarios
  - Provide troubleshooting guidance
  - Include recovery procedures

### 3. Handling Gaps and Ambiguities

When source material is unclear or incomplete:
1. Identify specific gaps or ambiguities
2. Request clarification from the Orchestrator
3. Make reasonable assumptions if necessary (and document them)
4. Verify technical details with the actual code

Use the `attempt_completion` protocol with `result: "clarification_needed"`:

```json
{
  "taskId": "DOC-API-001",
  "result": "clarification_needed",
  "summary": "Started creating API documentation but encountered ambiguities",
  "outputArtifacts": [
    {
      "type": "document",
      "path": "docs/api/authentication.md",
      "version": "draft",
      "description": "Partial API documentation with noted ambiguities"
    }
  ],
  "issues_encountered": [
    {
      "type": "clarification_needed",
      "description": "The error response format is not clearly specified in the LLD",
      "suggestedResolution": "Provide the standard error response format including all fields"
    }
  ]
}
```
