## Examples

### Example: Authentication Security Review

```markdown
# Security Review: Authentication System

## Overview
This security review covers the authentication system, including user registration, login, password reset, and session management.

## Summary of Findings

| ID | Finding | Severity | STRIDE Category | Status |
|----|---------|----------|----------------|--------|
| SEC-001 | Insufficient password complexity requirements | Medium | Information Disclosure | Open |
| SEC-002 | Missing rate limiting on login attempts | High | Spoofing | Open |
| SEC-003 | Session tokens with insufficient entropy | Critical | Spoofing | Open |
| SEC-004 | Insecure password reset mechanism | High | Account Takeover | Open |

## Detailed Findings

### SEC-001: Insufficient password complexity requirements

**Severity:** Medium

**STRIDE Category:** Information Disclosure

**Description:**
The current password policy only requires a minimum length of 6 characters with no complexity requirements. This makes passwords vulnerable to brute force and dictionary attacks.

**Affected Components:**
- User registration
- Password change functionality

**Impact:**
Weak passwords can be easily guessed or brute-forced, potentially leading to unauthorized account access.

**Recommendation:**
Implement stronger password requirements:
- Minimum length of 8 characters
- Require at least one uppercase letter
- Require at least one number
- Require at least one special character
- Check against common password lists

**Example Implementation:**
```javascript
function isStrongPassword(password) {
  // Check minimum length
  if (password.length < 8) {
    return { valid: false, reason: 'Password must be at least 8 characters long' };
  }
  
  // Check for uppercase letter
  if (!/[A-Z]/.test(password)) {
    return { valid: false, reason: 'Password must contain at least one uppercase letter' };
  }
  
  // Check for number
  if (!/[0-9]/.test(password)) {
    return { valid: false, reason: 'Password must contain at least one number' };
  }
  
  // Check for special character
  if (!/[^A-Za-z0-9]/.test(password)) {
    return { valid: false, reason: 'Password must contain at least one special character' };
  }
  
  // Check against common passwords (implementation would use a real list)
  const commonPasswords = ['Password123!', 'Admin123!', ...];
  if (commonPasswords.includes(password)) {
    return { valid: false, reason: 'Password is too common' };
  }
  
  return { valid: true };
}
```
```

### Example: Security-Focused Code Review

```markdown
# Security Code Review: Payment Processing

## Overview
This security code review focuses on the payment processing functionality, examining input validation, error handling, and secure communication with the payment gateway.

## Summary of Findings

| ID | Finding | Severity | STRIDE Category | Status |
|----|---------|----------|----------------|--------|
| SEC-001 | Unvalidated payment amount | High | Tampering | Open |
| SEC-002 | Payment API key stored in code | Critical | Information Disclosure | Open |
| SEC-003 | Insufficient error handling leaks information | Medium | Information Disclosure | Open |
| SEC-004 | Missing TLS certificate validation | High | Tampering | Open |

## Detailed Findings

### SEC-001: Unvalidated payment amount

**Severity:** High

**STRIDE Category:** Tampering

**Description:**
The payment amount is not properly validated before being sent to the payment gateway. The code accepts any numeric value, including negative amounts or zero.

**Affected Components:**
- PaymentProcessor.processPayment()

**Proof of Concept:**
```javascript
// Current implementation
function processPayment(amount, paymentMethod) {
  // No validation of amount
  return gateway.charge({
    amount: amount,
    payment_method: paymentMethod
  });
}

// Exploit
processPayment(-100.00, validPaymentMethod);
// This could potentially result in a refund instead of a charge
```

**Impact:**
An attacker could manipulate the payment amount to:
- Make purchases without payment (amount = 0)
- Potentially receive refunds (negative amounts)
- Bypass business logic that depends on payment amounts

**Recommendation:**
Implement proper validation of the payment amount:
- Ensure amount is positive
- Validate against the expected order total
- Set minimum and maximum allowed payment amounts
- Verify amount format and precision

**Example Implementation:**
```javascript
function processPayment(amount, paymentMethod, orderId) {
  // Validate amount
  if (typeof amount !== 'number' || isNaN(amount)) {
    throw new ValidationError('Payment amount must be a number');
  }
  
  if (amount <= 0) {
    throw new ValidationError('Payment amount must be greater than zero');
  }
  
  // Verify against order total
  const order = orderRepository.getById(orderId);
  if (!order) {
    throw new ValidationError('Invalid order ID');
  }
  
  if (Math.abs(amount - order.total) > 0.01) {
    throw new ValidationError('Payment amount does not match order total');
  }
  
  // Process payment
  return gateway.charge({
    amount: amount,
    payment_method: paymentMethod,
    order_id: orderId
  });
}
```
```
