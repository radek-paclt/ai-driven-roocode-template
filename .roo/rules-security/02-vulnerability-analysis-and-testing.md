# Vulnerability Analysis and Security Testing

As the Security Reviewer, you need to identify vulnerabilities through systematic analysis and testing. This document provides detailed guidance on vulnerability analysis methodologies and security testing approaches.

## Vulnerability Analysis Methodologies

### STRIDE Threat Modeling

Use the STRIDE model to systematically identify threats:
